            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               </gap>, as yet not apt to teach, and vnfit to be ouerſeers in a Congregation: for we must know what to teach for the matter, and how for the maner; and ſo to diuide the word aright to the hearers; which is required in all that preach vnto the people. And therefore to further both theſe, vpon theſe conſiderations duly weighed, I was encouraged to proceed and to vndergoe the maleuolous cenſure of this enuious age. First, for that I ſee many do obſerue this order in part, though not ſo exactly as were to be wiſhed, and as it is here by precepts briefly and plainly ſet downe, whoſe good approbation I hope to finde as maintenance againſt the rest. Secondly, for that I haue found by my owne experience in teaching, both the eaſineſſe thereof to be atteined ſoone vnto, as alſo that it is a very ſound &amp; profitable way, as I haue iudged hearing other, and they me, neither diſliked of any that I haue heard of, who list to ſpeake faithfully and with profit. Thirdly, for that I hauing vpon an occaſion ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died the 11. of the firſt of the Corinthians, from the 23. verſe to the end, I finde plainly this method ſet downe by the Apoſtle, and ſo hath it a diuine and Apostolicall approbation, for ſuppoſing the 23. 24. 25. verſes to be as his text out of Matth. 26. 26. 27. 28. the 26. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth the ſcope, the 27. is a doctrine, 28. an vſe, 29. a reaſon to enforce it, 30. and 31. the application of that which went before, to the preſent ſtate of the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians. 32. a preuention of an obiection which muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low application, as I haue declared in this treatiſe. 33. 34. a louing exhortation for the concluſion, with a briefe repetition of ſomewhat before reprehended, with a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed remedie for the ſame. This place gaue me the
<pb facs="tcp:1804:4"/> firſt and chiefeſt occaſion to write this treatiſe of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and method therein. Fourthly and laſtly, for that I hauing laboured for all ſuch both old and new which haue writen of this matter, to further me, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded my ſelfe that this my labour would not be vnac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to my brethren, as it hath beene to me a paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full worke, wherein I haue endeuoured to ſet downe much matter in very few words; and to illuſtrate the manifold precepts by euident examples briefly. If in all this I attaine to my deſire in any meaſure, I content my ſelfe: my will was to perfect, though thorow diſabilitie I leaue the worke imperfect. Nothing can bee ſo well done, but a want may be eſpied by ſome, or at leaſt ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be ſeene in the cunningeſt deuice of man; and all know, it is eaſier to find a fault, than either to begin well a cunning worke or rightly to finiſh an imperfect labour, or to amend perfectly what is amiſſe. I looke for carpers and ſuch as would find euen <hi>nodum in ſcirpo</hi> by an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uious eie in my labours. But if ſome profit, thoſe that be my friends, I bleſſe God, though other do not benefit: for as <hi>amici omnia amicè interpretantur &amp; in meliorem partem dubia accipiunt,</hi> ſo <hi>inimici &amp; inuidi malè omnia, &amp; peiorem in partem vel optima torquere ſtudent.</hi> I preſume not to make a rule to any, nor to tie all to one method, but as men ſhall find which is the beſt, that let them in iudgement approue without partiall affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. I deſire that mens perſons may not at any time be preiudiciall to their labors. Wiſe men in ſuch caſes doe weigh in iudgement the ſubſtance, and are not with partiall affection miſled by circumſtance. So reade and iudge, as if you that reade were your ſelues the Authors. In a word, do as you would be done vnto.</p>

               <p>WE ſee it is no diſgrace for any to be a Miniſter of the Goſpell, and is a calling woorthie of any qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1804:8"/> in the excellenteſt maner; yet is not euerie one woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of it, not fit for it: but ſuch as are called and ſent of God, being furniſhed with gifts in ſome meaſure to be able to diſcharge the office of a Teacher, and alſo ſtirred vp with a godly affection to deſire the ſame.</p>
               <p>Thus being ſent of God, the Church by examination<note place="margin">A Minister muſt be ſent of God, and called of the Church.</note> muſt, or they to whom the authoritie of the Church is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> trie thee and approouing thee by finding thee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with ſuch gifts as is neceſſarie for a Miniſter, muſt call and inſtitute one lawfully preſented to a Paſtorall charge to take care ouer the flocke. Wee may not take it vpon vs before we be called: if any runne before the Lord call, as many doe for profit, eaſe, and honour, we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne<note place="margin">Luk. 24. Act. 1.</note> ourſelues for haſte, and goe without expectation of good ſpeed. God appoints none but he prepareth them before, and giueth them gifts to performe their dutie. <hi>Conſidera</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Ierom) Sacerdotum eſſe officium de lege in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogantibus</hi>

               <p>Againe, if we ruſh in without authoritie of the Church, it is preſumption, contempt of Superioritie, breach of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the nurſe of confuſion, the mother of ſchiſme, and bane of Churches peace: Begin well, and better hope there is to end well.

Begin<note place="margin">Cauſes moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to the Miniſterie.</note> not for profit, for feare of pouertie, nor for eaſe, becauſe thou art loth to labour, neither for honour to be had in eſtimation.

The Lord ſhewes why he hath appointed Paſtors for his Church: if we intend any other thing ſiniſterly, ſeeking by it, which it in Gods appointment aimeth not at, it is to abuſe hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critically holie things by a deceitfull heart; as <hi>Ieſabell</hi> did a faſt for <hi>Naboths</hi> vineyard; but ſuch hearts ſhew themſelues actiuely thorow idleneſſe, conetouſneſſe, or proud aſpiring afterwards.</p>
               <p>When God hath furniſhed, and the Church approoued,<note place="margin">The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters gifts must fit his place.</note> then as Gods gifts come freely, ſo purchaſe not at anie hand a place by Symonie: Neither chuſe it after thy appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite for the beſt Benefice, but after thy gifts, as thou maiſt moſt profit a people.</p>
               <p>A man may bee a fit Miniſter of Chriſt, yet not meet for euery Congregation; few ſo qualified: a milde and a ſoft ſpirit to a meeke companie; a lowe voice to a little audito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, els ſome few heare, and the reſt muſt ſtand &amp; gaze: an vndauntable minde to ſtubborne perſons; <hi>Duris nodis du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus exhibeatur cuneus;</hi> a loud voice to a great aſſembly, to a more learned Church a better Clerke; and one of leſſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding to a ruder ſort: Ioine like vnto like, that Paſtor and flocke may fit together, for their beſt good.</p>
               <p>The congregation reapes ſmall benefit where the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers gifts fit not for the place: Therefore as wee muſt haue conſcience to enter into the Miniſterie rightly; ſo muſt we be verie reſpectiue to ſettle our ſelues with a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple conueniently, for our beſt comfort and their more edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>

               <p>Praier muſt bee the Proeme; it is the Lord that both giues wiſedome to vnderſtand, and words of vtterance: it is the ſpirit that ſtrengtheneth their hearts in ſpeaking, that guides them in the trueth, calles things to their remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, &amp; makes them able Miniſters of the Goſpell.

                  </note> Diſciples might not goe out before they had receiued the ſpirit; neither may wee goe vp and ſpeake without it. It is not by the inſtrument that men are conuerted; neither in the words lieth the power to ſaue: But it is the Lords bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing thereupon, who thereby addeth to the Church ſuch as are ordained to be ſaued. <hi>Paul</hi> plants, <hi>Appollo</hi> waters, but God giues the increaſe; els is al in vaine, though woonders were ſhewed from heauen with the preaching of the Word.</p>

It muſt bee with vnderſtanding and affection; the matter well digeſted into order, and vttered in few words briefly.</p>

               <p>Halfe houre Praiers are too tedious, vſuall with ſome men, which is their indiſcretion; weariſome to all, liked of none, but ſuch as vſe them, who ſeeme to ſtriue to win God by words, or to waſte time.

It were better to come a little ſhort on the right hand heerein,<note place="margin">Iob 32. 21. 22.</note> than goe to farre on the left.

As it may argue ſome preſumption and pride in the Corrector, ſo it may breed contention, and leaue a great ſcruple, and caſt doubts into the hearers mindes, what reckoning to make of a tranſlation; and it giues great aduantage to the Papiſts; who heereby labour to foreſtall many, that they ſmally account of our tranſlations; which we ſee can neuer be ſo well done and generally approoued of, but ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſons will be cenſuring the ſame, and that not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in priuate (a thing happely tolerable if the cenſure bee true, and wiſely proceeded in) but alſo they muſt needs ſhew their skill in Pulpits.

                  <p>This is an obſcure Scripture, &amp; cannot be meant literal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie as the Papiſts expound them; as if Chriſt had ſaid; This bread is my naturall bodie, borne of the virgin <hi>Marie</hi> my mother, by tranſubſtantiation; for it is abſurd and too groſſe a conceit: Therefore we ſearch out another ſenſe, and ſay as if Chriſt had ſaid, indeed as hee meant; <hi>This bread is a ſigne of my body, or my body Sacramentally.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now to trie out expoſitions, we muſt come to the former Rules: Firſt to confute the Papiſts, before we confirme our owne: the matter in hand is about the Sacrament, (for this is euer to be marked, of what the place ſpeaketh, that ſo we may referre it to ſome Catechiſme point, to trie the interpretation by, as places ſpeaking of Chriſt, we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:1804:21"/> them to his nature or offices, and according vnto the Principles therein learned examine our expoſitions.) Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are to referre this Predication to the doctrine of Sacraments, where we ſhall find their expoſition to bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the nature of a Sacrament, which is a relation and not truely a ſubſtance; a ſigne as well, as the thing ſignified.<note place="margin">Chriſt is not bodily in the Sacrament.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>II. Bring it to another part of the Catechiſme, to the Creed, and we ſhall find it to be againſt two Articles of the ſame; of Chriſts true humane nature, hauing a true body with all the dimenſions, which being ſo, cannot be incloſed in a wafer cake. Alſo againſt Chriſt ſitting at the right hand of his father, which is euer true at all moment of times: but this cannot I beleeue, if he be in the Sacrament, and euery morning Maſſe, and ſo often as the Sacrament is celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. It cannot be ſaid that one true body can be at one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in two places.</p>
                  <p>III. Trie by the circumſtances of the place, and it is ouerthrowen, conſidering who adminiſtred it, Ieſus Chriſt ſitting at the table, and the bread in his hand: by which either muſt his body ſitting at the table be a fantaſticall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, if the bread was his true body; or the bread but bread: if the bread was then but bread, it was not tranſubſtantiated, belike till after his reſurrection, and in ſo ſaying the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution ſhould be defectiue, and the diſciples of Chriſt to receiue leſſe than we do, if it be now tranſubſtantiated. Note againe, that it is called bread, and appeares euer bread: now if it were changed, it were a miracle: and no miracle but it was ſenſible. The Diſciples they tooke it, ſaw Chriſt when they eat it, and felt no fleſh. The end of a Sacrament is to remember him; now we remember not things preſent: it is againſt therefore the end of a Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>IV. Laſtly, it is againſt Scripture; <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 21. The expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition therefore is falſe, too Caniball like, allowing the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of mans fleſh; which the Iewes abhorred to heare of.

Heere firſt a Teacher muſt begin to builde, that knowledge may goe before zeale to guide the ſame: this of ſome is called the Didaſcalike or Doctrinal part of a
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:1804:26"/> Sermon, wherein a trueth is deliuered and confirmed; by this we onely learne to know and beleeue: But to effect and doe is another part of the Sermon, following vpon this: <hi>As for example.</hi> This is a plain Doctrine deliuered by the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Prou. 29. 18. Where there is no viſion, the people periſh:</hi> This onely informeth my iudgement to take knowledge of a thing, which is this; That they which want the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of Gods word, are in a fearefull eſtate; it is neither exhortation, dehortation, reprehenſion, commandement, promiſe, nor any ſuch thing, (for theſe indeed are conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents of doctrines.) Many ſuch places be, which are eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent doctrines of themſelues: <hi>Roman. 8. 1. 1. Corint. 2. 14. Galath. 3. 10. 11. Hebr. 13. 4.

               <p>They are a Doctrine of themſelues as other Prouerbes be: Heere then begin to expound the words thus: <hi>Where there is no:</hi> in the Hebrue it is onely, <hi>in not,</hi> a Prepoſition with an Aduerbe, in ſtead of a Noune; meaning in the want, or in not hauing viſion. <hi>Viſion,</hi> this word is diuerſly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in Scripture: firſt for an ordinarie meanes wherby God<note place="margin">The diuers acceptions of a word, and the ſame prooued.</note> reuealed his will to his Prophets, as <hi>Numb.</hi> 12. 6. and 24. 4.

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:1804:27"/> 
                  <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. 4. 19. In this laſt ſenſe muſt this word viſion be taken,<note place="margin">After that the diuers ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of the word is noted, them ſet downe one proper and apt for the text, and prooue how that, and not the other is fitteſt. The emphaſis is noted, and how it ſerues to the purpoſe.</note> and not in any of the three former ſenſes; for this propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is generall and euer true; but if we put in ſtead of viſion, Hieruſalem, it would be abſurd to ſay, Where there is no Hieruſalem, the people periſh: or, vnderſtand it of viſion to <hi>Moſes,</hi> or the other which were but temporary, &amp; are cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> muſt therfore we periſh? It is to be interpreted therfore, preaching, called viſion and prophecie for the excellencie thereof; ſo do alſo the learned expound it. <hi>The people,</hi> that is, perſons of all ſorts, and not onely the ruder multitude; the word is generall, and conteineth all. <hi>Periſh,</hi> there is a ſingular emphaſis in this word, and therefore interpretors diuerſlietranſlate it, To ceaſe and leaue off; to decay; to go backe, to rebell, to be naked, to periſh: all which doe well agree to this matter in hand. So it is, as if <hi>Salomon</hi> had ſaid more at large; Where men are without, and want the true<note place="margin">A paraphraſe briefe in ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant words, according to the explanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaſis of the words.</note> preaching of Gods word; there all ſorts of men begin to giue ouer good things which before they delighted in, they decaie in graces, and fall backe, become rebellious and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly diſpoſed, whereby they make themſelues naked of all graces, yea of Gods fauour, expoſing themſelues to their ſpirituall enemies, and ſo periſh and come to deſtruction. Thus you ſee the doctrine explaned and enlarged by a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphraſe, to the capacitie of leuerie one; whereof in the next place are vſes to bee made, and then as one thinks good, he may make ſome obſeruation beſides, after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation, acception, emphaſis, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The gathering of a doctrine, is where the doctrine is not<note place="margin">What it is to gather a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and when, and alſo how.</note> expreſſed in the text, and is collected by good conſequent neceſſarilie. The doctrine is not to bee written from the text, as if the text were drawen to the leſſon; and not the doctrine from it; but muſt follow <hi>iuſtâ conſequentiâ;</hi> ſo is the collection <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, which is by helpe of Logicall affection of arguments; from a generall to a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; from the whole, to the parts; from the proper adiunct, to the ſubiect; and from the cauſe, effect, ſubiect, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, comparats, definition and diſtribution. <hi>As for example:
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:1804:27"/> Ierem. 31. 31. I will make a new couenant;</hi> out of which, this doctrine I gather from the adiunct: That the Law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> was not to bee perpetuall, but for a time till an other come in place thereof. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13. 4.

                  </hi> in Gods Church, mightie in the Scriptures, ſhewing by Scripture that which he teacheth, <hi>Act.</hi> 18. 24. 28. and ſhall conuince the conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of gaine-ſaiers, and eſtabliſh the trueth in the hearts of the beleeuers, and be bold to vrge it vpon the hearers, as ſpeaking with iudgement from authoritie.</p>
               <p>In gathering doctrines which may be diuers waies obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,<note place="margin">Whence to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect doctrines.</note> proceed in this order, both naturall, helpefull to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie, and alſo will occaſion a man to thinke of manie leſſons.</p>
               <p n="1">I. From the occaſion of that Scripture; as diuers occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons<note place="margin">From the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> were of the <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> of S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles of the ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of our Sauiour Chriſt; of the Sermons in the <hi>Acts;</hi> and the ſame of other Scriptures, ſometimes one, ſometimes an other, and ſo accordingly may many doctrines be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered.</p>
               <p n="2">II. From the coherence (when it is) with the other words<note place="margin">From the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be a bare affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. A reaſon, or moe reaſons of that which went before: a preuention of an obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: a concluſion</note> in that place of Scripture:</p>
               <p>If a Reaſon, it may teach to obſerue, that a reaſon is to be giuen of that which is deliuered for confirmation, and that a bare aſſertion without proofe is not ſufficient.</p>
               <p>If the matter bee followed, but without any reaſon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed, it may ſhew the ſame ſufficiently prooued, and eaſie to be receiued.</p>
               <p>If moe reaſons bee brought in, and the matter much vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and largely ſtood vpon, it argues the neceſſity of that point; the earneſt endeuour of the author therein, &amp; that it
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:1804:28"/> is hardlie receiued of men as it ought, or eaſily reiected as<note place="margin">on: a ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort. dehor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat. comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, &amp;c.</note> it ought not to be.</p>
               <p>If the words be a preuention of an obiection, wee may gather that in teaching, there is as well required wiſdome to preuent a foe, as to inſtruct a friend.</p>
               <p>If a concluſion; a time to be obſerued to end euery thing, wherein is wiſedome how farre to ſpeake in a matter, and when to conclude and be ſilent.</p>
               <p>If the words bee a ſimilitude, to illuſtrate the matter; it may not the obſcuritie of the point handled, or the plaine and euident dealing of the Author, noting withall the kind of ſimilitude, and whence it is fetched.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, If an exhortation, threat, promiſe, &amp;c. wee may collect the vſe of them, for that end which the ſpirit vſeth them.</p>
               <p>Alſo from Commandement affirmatiue and exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; that we are vnapt and ſlow to a thing.

               <p n="3">III. From the ſcope and maine drift of the words:<note place="margin">From the ſcope. There is but one true ſenſe of a place, one ſcope, and one proper do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. Of a generall propoſition or doctrine ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered out of many words, from the moſt principall ſcope.</note> which doctrine is chiefe and principall of that Scripture As there is but one drift, ſo but one proper and moſt naturall doctrine of that place, which though it may be deliuered in a few words, yet it is conteined ſometimes in many, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time in fewer verſes or words. <hi>As for example.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In handling the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> after the Preface to come to the matter, we ſhall finde the firſt ſcope and principall propoſition, conteining the ſame, to bee this: <hi>That there is but one way for all, Iew or Gentile to attaine ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, euen by the faith in Chriſt, wrought by the Goſpell, the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of God to ſaluation:</hi> which doctrine is conteined and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed from the 16. <hi>verſe</hi> of the firſt Chapter, to the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the 19. <hi>chap.</hi> whereunto all that is ſpoken is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, as conteining reaſons to confirme the ſame.</p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:1804:28"/>
               <p>But now heere note, as there is a generall ſcope, and ſo a<note place="margin">Propoſitions or doctrines leſſe generall drawen from the words which haue a more ſpeciall ſcope. The leſſe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall prooueth the more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.</note> doctrine; ſo are there other propoſitions leſſe generall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined within the ſame, and ſerue to prooue the more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall; the words hauing a generall ſcope to prooue like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe theſe leſſe generall propoſitions. As to declare my meaning: The generall and principall propoſition you heare what it is, now beſides, the Apoſtle deliuers other propoſitions, Generall as <hi>Rom. 3. 9. All men are ſinners;</hi> which doctrine is conteined from the 18. <hi>verſ.</hi> of the firſt <hi>chap.</hi> to the 19. <hi>verſe</hi> of the 3. <hi>chap.</hi> Againe, that the workes of the Law iuſtifie none: That faith alone iuſtifieth. All which propoſitions, as they proue the principal ſcope; ſo the verſes wherein theſe prepoſitions are ſet downe, muſt yeeld theſe doctrines, &amp; the words muſt be applied to proue the ſame: For wee cannot inferre by a true immediate conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, the principall propoſition out of them, which haue a<note place="margin">Some verſes or words, which come in by the way, prooue not other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions either general or ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall, but haue an eſpeciall drift as the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion is, for which they are brought, and ſo thereafter is the doctrine thence to be collected.</note> more particular ſcope. Again, this is to be marked, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie things come into a diſcourſe by the way, in handling of a matter, which are carefully to be obſerued &amp; taken heede vnto, which neither ſerue to prooue either the principall ſcope, or the leſſe generall doctrines; but comming in by way of preuention or other occaſions haue (as I may ſaie) their indiuiduate ſcope: and ſo their like diſtinct and ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall doctrines by themſelues, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 1. 2. where the ſcope is not that <hi>all are ſinners;</hi> but to ſhew by way of preuention; that though the Iewes as well as the Gentiles be vnder ſin: yet haue they their preferment aboue theſe: there is the ſcope differing, the doctrine muſt differ alſo. So the <hi>v.</hi> 3. and 4. proue not the prerogatiue of the Iewes; the ſcope of the two firſt verſes: but are brought in by occaſion of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles owne words, to preuent them. The purpoſe whereof is to ſhew that God is true and iuſt in his word and promiſe (though ſome do not beleeue the ſame) and is not without effect.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee ſcope vpon ſcope in handling one chiefe point; where alſo wee vnderſtand how the generall is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued by the ſpeciall: the ſpeciall by the words, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:1804:29"/> them ſame: ſo alſo will the words of an indiuiduate proue the ſcope, and propoſition gathered from thence: <hi>As for example: Act.</hi> 15. 21.</p>
               <p>Which words containe reaſons why the beleeuing Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles<note place="margin">An example, ſha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ing how the words prooue the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral doctrine or ſcope, and that the ſame words affoord ſeuerall leſſons agreeing with the principall doctrine and ſcope.</note> in ſome things ſhould reſtraine their liberty for the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker Iewes ſake, who might be eaſily offended: and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly yet bee drawen to their liberty in Chriſt by the impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments heerein declared: it is the ſpeciall ſcope of theſe two verſes, 20. 21. differing from that which went before.</p>
               <p>The doctrine is this: That the ſtronger is to beare with the weaker in indifferent things, when they ſee reaſons that as yet hold them in their weakneſſe, till they be better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed: euery word containeth a reaſon to enforce this leſſon to be receiued of the Gentiles, in the Iewes behalfe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From the authority of their opinion, <hi>Moſes</hi> the man of God. 2. From the antiquity of it. 3. From the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity thereof, <hi>in euery city.</hi> 4. For that there be preachers and vpholders of the ſame. 5. They haue the letter plainly, for that they hold. 6. They ſee yet a preſent publicke obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of <hi>Moſes, euery ſabbath.</hi> Therfore ſithence they haue ſuch pulbackes, reaſons yet to withhold them, they are a while to be borne withall: and their liberty for feare of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to be reſtrained.</p>
               <p>The ſcope thus we ſee, and the words to containe reaſons and arguments to enforce the ſame, out of which arguments many doctrines may be gathered agreeing vnto the ſcope: <hi>As thus:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Opinions of great perſons once generally receiued are of great authority to bind men vnto them, and hardly can they be induced to forſake the ſame.</p>
               <p>That antiquity, and ſo cuſtome, in any religion holds ſo profeſſors to like thereof, as they will hardly ſee their errors, and yeeld to a manifeſt truth of late come to light, and<note place="margin">From the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the words Grammatical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torically.</note> knowen but to ſome. And ſo of all the reſt of the former reaſons may thus leſſons be gathered fitly, to informe out iudgements from the ſcope.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. From the maner of deliuering the words, by a

               <p>The common maner of proceeding into a Common place, is by theſe formes, (as) heere let vs ſee what this is: (or) we haue occaſion hence to ſpeake of ſuch a matter,<note place="margin">When to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon place.</note> and ſo foorth. But yet it is not conuenient to take euerie where occaſion to Common place vpon anie word, but vpon ſuch as the text may well affoord, when the people need to be enformed thereof as yet ignorant, being an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catechiſed Congregation: or when ſome notable vice is commonly committed, and neceſſarily to be corrected: or ſome godlie dutie to bee commended; happelie made then no account of, or contemned, as is the preaching of the Word, and ſo foorth.</p>
               <p n="10">X. From a thing by proportion and reſemblance to an<note place="margin">For a thing by ſimilitude and proportion.</note> other, as <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11. 1. as <hi>Abraham</hi> left his naturall country at Gods bidding, to enioy Canaan; ſo muſt we this world, to inherit heauen. And ſuch leſſons may be followed and vrged, where good reaſon may be giuen of a true proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betweene things compared: as <hi>Abraham</hi> fitly heere may
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:1804:31"/> be for euerie Chriſtian; and Canaan was a true type of heauen.</p>
               <p>Thus wee ſee how wee may make an Allegorie, which is<note place="margin">How to Allo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorize law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</note> not ſimplie vnlawfull; for the Apoſtle doth allegorize, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 9. And it is but an argument drawen from a ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, when the words are expounded myſtically, otherwiſe then the litterall ſenſe doth affoord.</p>
               <p>But in gathering allegories: Firſt, gather them after the true and naturall ſenſe be deliuered, and not before. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, let them not be too farre fetched, ſtrained, obſcure, or fooliſh: but agreeing with the Analogie of Faith, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manifeſt Scriptures. The beſt Allegorizing is when the parts of the allegorie may be referred to other Scriptures, ſpeaking of the ſame properly, as <hi>Matt.</hi> 26. 36. and ſo forth. Where Chriſt may reſemble euery paſtor: <hi>Peter, Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> Chriſtian profeſſours. <hi>Gethſamine,</hi> the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; their ſleepe, ſinne; <hi>Iudas,</hi> the diuell.</p>
               <p>The proportion then is this: As the Diſciples in <hi>Gethſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mene,</hi> though warned to watch and pray till Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to them againe, yet fell ſoone aſleepe: and had not Chriſt returned and awaked them, <hi>Iudas</hi> and his traine ſuddenly had ſeazed vpon them. Euen ſo, though a Paſtor teach his flocke, and forewarne them, and leaue them but a while to themſelues; they will ſoone fall to ſinne, and bee ſuddenly ouertaken of the diuell and his inſtruments, if hee come not eftſoones againe to call them, and ſtirre them vp to godlineſſe. This allegorie is true, and apt; for Chriſt is called a Paſtour; the three Diſciples were Chriſtians; ſinne is called ſleepe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. and <hi>Iudas</hi> a diuell; men are apt to ſinne, as to ſleepe; and the abſence of a Paſtor very perilous: <hi>Prou.</hi> 29. 18. ſo as this agreeth with other Scriptures and the Analogie of faith. Thirdly, handle an allegorie briefly, and vſe them not too often. Fourthly, let the vſe and end be for inſtruction of life, but not for any proofe of doctrine. Fiftly, let the ancient, graue, and wiſe collect them. It is not a ſafe way for yoong beginners not well exerciſed in the Scriptures, and grounded in the trueth. Allegories are
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:1804:32"/> delightfull, and therefore youth will (as I may ſay) <hi>laſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uire,</hi> ſoone waxe wanton immoderately heerein, and ſo in ſtead of vſing, abuſe the Scripture.</p>

                  <head>Allegories may be gathered diuerſly.</head>

                  <p>Thirdly, from thoſe Scriptures, where the words haue a ſhew of an vntrueth in the letter, and muſt bee vnderſtood figuratiuely, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9. 13. which Chriſt litterally taken ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer did, <hi>Pſal. 1 18. 22.

                  <p>Laſtly, where the words be typicall: either in precept, as <hi>Exod. 22. 18. 19. Leu. 12. 2. 3, or Example,</hi> as in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Gen. 22. Ioſua, Sampſon, Dauid,</hi> and others.</p>
                  <p n="11">XI. Laſtly, from Similitudes many leſſons be gathered,<note place="margin">From ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes.</note> and that two waies:</p>

                  <p>The ſcope is to ſhew by the ſimilitude, that the Law of<note place="margin">An example.</note> God makes not freee, but keeps in bondage: for it doth with vs as tutors and gouernours do with an heire, being a child; euen keepe him vnder as a ſeruant.</p>
                  <p>The leſſon from the ſcope is: that the Law is ſeruitude, and freeth not, neither can it, more then tutors a child: but is at the fathers appointment.</p>
                  <p>From the letter this leſſon. That a wiſe and a godly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will bring vp his child well, though he be his only ſon and heire, vnder tutors and gouernours. For we muſt know that the thing, from whence the ſimilitude is fetched, is the ſame in it ſelfe, for which it is brought to illuſtrate another. If the wrath of a King be fearefull as the roaring of a Lion: then a Lions roaring is fearefull.</p>
                  <p>This collecting of leſſons from a ſimilitude, is not onely when it is largely ſet downe, but euen contained in one word by a Metaphor; as when a Miniſter is called a ſhepheard; and a beleeuer, a ſheepe; a wicked man, a dogge; wee may note the nature of the thing whence the ſimilie is drawen: and ſo farre as it may well agree to the thing to which it is brought, apply the ſame in the ſeuerall properties to it as doctrines, but then proue them in the application and make vſe thereof.</p>

Thirdly, conſider whether it be neceſſarie to be mentioned and confuted, before that auditorie: and alſo when conueniently. Fourthly, not to ſtand long vpon it, but ſo farre as may be thought expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to the edification of the hearers. It is altogether a fault, to ſpend in Countrie and rude aſſemblies, the whole time, or moſt part of the Sermon in ſome point of controuerſies: as ſome vſe to doe without iuſt occaſion, or neceſſary cauſe.

It furthers much the matter, and cuts off the<note place="margin">Why and how to preuent ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections.</note> occaſion of cauils.

Secondly, when either a doctrine gathered, cauſeth anie, or a mans owne words, in following a matter, occaſioneth

Fourthly, when a controueſie is to be handled in a learned auditorie, againſt the common aduerſarie. In which reſpects preuention of obiections is to be vſed.</p>
               <p>The obiections either openly to bee made, or cloſely to<note place="margin">What things to be preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> be preuented, are ſuch, as the omitting thereof, might oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion in thy ſpeeches either conceit of error, ſome appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of ſinne, or ſome ſenſeleſſe abſurditie: alſo whaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer may be a let and hinderance to the receiuing of that which is taught or exhorted vnto, muſt by this meanes bee remooued.

                  <hi>CHAP. XIII.</hi> Of ſuch things as are required of a Miniſter to performe the whole worke.</head>
               <p>HItherto hath beene deliuered what is required and to<note place="margin">What things generally ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie to a preacher.</note> be done in ſeuerall parts. Now followes to ſhew what is neceſſary for a Preacher to haue in all and euery part, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite for the well performance of the whole.</p>
               <p n="1">I. Is a quicke apprehenſion, either in premeditation,<note place="margin">A quicke ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion.</note> or els in publicke deliuerie: thereby to take what the ſpirit of God preſently doth offer to our minds. The holy Ghoſt forſakes not his owne worke, neither ſaileth to aſſiſt a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Miniſter, but euen in his preparation is with him; and helps by affoording much in the verie ſpeaking not before thought of. A man not ſlauiſhly bound to words, brings not all things with him into the Pulpit, that there is deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. The ſpirit in Praier helps, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. ſo doth he in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; if there be a ready conceit to take it.</p>
               <p>Heereto muſt be added inuention to finde out, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to know the thing what it is, iudgement to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of it, to bring euery thing into his proper place; and prudence to diſcerne rightly to make application, according to conuenient circumſtances and occaſions.</p>
               <p n="2">II. A good memorie, firme and ſtable to retaine at leaſt<note place="margin">A good memorie.</note> things newly thought vpon; which is a preſent memorie: without this it is impoſſible to become plentifull in matter, or in exhortation vehement: for in the one a brickle memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie will omit much, and in the other, a Miniſter will ſoone forget himſelfe where he was, and what about.</p>
               <p>A perfect memorie needeth no precept, happie is he that hath it: it is the ſtore-houſe to vnderſtanding, and treaſure of eloquence, if wit want not, nor the toong bee tied: by helpe of a good memory, a man with eaſe may ſpeake as<note place="margin">How to helpe the weakeneſſe of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.</note> much as he pleaſeth, and as he is diſpoſed alſo.</p>
               <p>A weake memorie needeth helpe, and thus it may bee ſtrengthened. Firſt, vnderſtand well the thing to be deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:1804:46"/> for as S. <hi>Hierome</hi> ſaith, <hi>quae firmiter concepimus, benè lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quimur, ſiquidem talia in ammae quaſi ſubſtantiam concoquendo ſunt conuerſa.</hi> Things of thine owne deuiſing are beſt for memorie, and more eaſie to be borne away: that which is from other more hardly, and ſcarcely not at all, without the right vnderſtanding of the matter, without which a man repeats but words, as a Parat. Secondly, diſpoſe into order and method what thou art to deliuer: an vnorderly heap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vp of things together confounds memorie. As memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie is the maintainer of knowledge, ſo is method the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer<note place="margin">Of writing Sermons, the profit and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity therof. See Hipperius in his firſt booke of fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Sermons cap. 6.</note> of memorie. Thirdly, write what thou wouldeſt ſpeake: writing confirmes meditation, ſhewes the minde to the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and keepes things once thought of: it makes thoughts ſet downe, better to be iudged, either by a mans ſelfe, or by an other, to whom it may be imparted, for their approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or correction: <hi>Difficile eſt</hi> ſaith one, <hi>ſimul cogitare, &amp; qualiter cogites iudicare, ex nuda mentis cogitatione.</hi> It fixeth more firmely what is thought vpon, brings to a ſtile and kinde of ſpeaking, it preſerues a mans labours thereby af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, to iudge how he profits, to pleaſure himſelfe, by peruſing againe former meditations, (more eaſilie found in writing, than called to minde) or any other by his labour, if it be held woorth looking on. It declareth his induſtry, and paines to ſpeake profitablie, with vnderſtanding of that he deliuereth. In writing a man loſeth no thoughts, ſo as at one time, its not requiſite, ſo exactly to remember what he hath inuented, whileſt his minde muſing vpon farther matter, as hee muſt doe in meditating without ſetting it downe. Laſtly, in ſtudie, whileſt one is intent vpon a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, often occaſion is giuen of further matter, which ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth from reading or meditation, which, if it bee not noted downe, will, in following the point in hand, ſoone ſlippe out of minde, and hardly to be recalled, except memorie bee verie good. Therefore it is good to write, and in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to haue a voide or emptie paper by, to ſet downe foorth with what comes to minde, which will after fitly ſerue in the right place: wee ſee writing to be exceeding profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:1804:47"/> euerie way for our ſelues and others: and nothing ſhould let from this: <hi>Sed eſt magni laboris quem deſides nos plerun<expan>

Beware heerein of a wauering minde, and by-thoughts: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin not immediately vpon wearineſſe, and ſerious ſtudie before, without ſome relaxation betweene: not ſudden from one thing to another; nor vpon vehement paſſions, as of anger, ſorrow, feare, ioy, and ſo forth. Take alſo time for it, <hi>Nam ſicut concoctioni corporali ſpacium damus &amp; quie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem: ita &amp; meditations mentis; quae mentalis quaedam concoctio est; quâm animae nutrimentum cedat materia:</hi> How much is ſufficient to be allotted to meditation, is to be iudged from euerie mans induſtrie, and abilitie in quickneſſe of conceit, and firmeneſſe of memorie to retaine, which is more or leſſe in euerie one. His meditation and paines muſt be ſo, as that hee may preach ſo often as is conuenient for the people.</p>
               <p>The time when: it is not good after meat, the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding<note place="margin">Time.</note> then is dulled: and as memorie is leſſe able to beare away, and minde to conceiue, ſo its hurtfull for the bodie, ſerious meditation much hindring natures worke in concoction. Secondly, it is beſt ouer night immediatelie before ſleepe: and foorthwith awaking earely in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: <hi>aurora Muſis amica:</hi> It may be lying, ſitting, ſtanding, or walking, as a man perceiueth what is beſt for himſelfe, and is moſt vſed vnto: but in walking beware of oft turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: which is hurtfull to the braine.</p>
               <p>For the place, let it be ſolitary, leſt with noiſe to the eares,<note place="margin">Place.</note> &amp; variene of obiect to the eies, the mind be diſtracted: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let it be too darke, nor yet too light: a meane is beſt in all. Some in meditating doe vſe to ſpeake and geſture; but this is a forewearing of the ſpirits, and too Hiſtrionian like.</p>
               <p>In thy meditation, two things are to be thought vpon:<note place="margin">Matter.</note> Firſt, the matter to be handled. Secondly, &amp; the order, how to proceed according to this former method ſet downe: doctrines with proofe, vſe with reaſons, application with preuention of obiections, and finally the concluſion.</p>

It poſſeſſeth a man with feare, which confounds memorie, it curbes the good moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the ſpirit, and preuents a man of the benefit of ſuch things, as in ſpeaking might offer themſelues to his vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. Vpon preſent occaſion, ſuch an one, can neither ſpeake more, nor otherwiſe, than hee hath committed to memorie before: a verie great hurt to a mans Miniſterie: and hinderance to the courſe thereof in pronuntiation alſo, action, and affection. If a man feare to want words, let him be well prouided for matter and words <hi>non inuita ſequentur,</hi> as one well ſaith.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, and laſtly (if all theſe meanes be not ſufficient to helpe thy memorie; that ſo thou maieſt deliuer thy minde, both for matter, and maner, as thou wouldeſt, and as thou haſt ſet it downe without faile) adde this helpe withall: note the chiefe heads of thy ſpeech briefly in a little peece of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,<note place="margin">No diſgrace to note the chiefe heads of the Sermon in a little paper to helpe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie.</note> a word or two for euery ſeuerall thing, <hi>quae breuis de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineatio, erit memoriae preſens ſubſidium, ſi in libro repoſitam &amp; fixam eam ad manum inter concionandum in pulpito habeas.</hi>

                     </expan> foelici.</hi> So as we ſee it is ancient &amp; no diſgrace at all. It was a common thing in <hi>Gregories</hi> time, out of writings to ſpeake to the people as <hi>Hiperius</hi> hath noted
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:1804:48"/> out of one of his Homilies vpon <hi>Marke,</hi> 16. Its better by this meanes, to helpe defect of memorie, to vtter all thy labour, and with incouragement, without feare to ſpeake, to vrge a matter affectionately, and to proſecute things fullie, as it pleaſeth thee, knowing at hand preſent helpe, to keepe thee in minde, with a little glance of the eie, where thou art, &amp; to bring thee fitly to that which doth follow; al which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit thou haſt heereby. Then knowing thy memory to be weake, it is preſumption to attempt to ſpeake without this helpe, with feare, with ſome diſcouragement, to follow largely any point; and by forgetfulneſſe to deliuer little of much, before thought vpon, or els confuſedly to vtter di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers things, &amp; impertinent withall. It is more laudable and profitable, than that conceited Arte of Memorie, diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious diuers waies, yea and wicked alſo; as is prooued by the learned. Natures want muſt needs, and may by good meanes, be lawfully holpen. Good gifts many haue from God, yet with ſome defect this way: good vnderſtanding, honeſt hearts, feruent zeale and free libertie of ſpeech: the benefit whereof, it were not well for the Church to loſe, for ſo little a defect, ſupplied by ſo good meanes, which to ſome which write well, and haue a quicke eie to the note, is no hinderance to ſtay them in vtterance, but a ſingular encouragement, who can ſo ſpeake, as if they neither had note, neither needed the ſame in the iudgement of the hearers.</p>

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:1804:48"/> varietie of things require varietie of words, and that is a proper Epithet, and fit phraſe for one thing, which is not meete for an other. Speake of warres like a warriour and a martiall man in his tearmes: of Ciuill gouernment like a States man: picture out vice in his deformitie, and draw out vertue in her liuely colours: vttter threats with words of terror, and the merciful kindneſſe of the Lord, with alluring ſpeeches of conſolation. Be not too baſe, vſe no fooliſh termes, ridiculous, too meane for the matter, for feare of contempt: no ſcurrilous, railing common termes. Theſe be incident and vnbeſeeming the ſtaid grauity of Gods Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours. Preuent hatred: neither bee too lofty in hie tearmes, ſtrange ſpeeches, huffing words. Beware of fooliſh affectation, that we blaſe not our pride, and too great folly. There is a godly eloquence, approued by the Scripture:<note place="margin">Godly elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and how to be attained vnto.</note> many ſpeake well by nature, an excellent gift of God: and many by induſtrie attaine to commendation herein, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding well penned works, by hearing the Sermons of ſuch as be endued with eloquence, by conuerſing and talking with thoſe that can ſpeake well, and putting in practiſe what they attaine vnto, till they come vnto an habit. No<note place="margin">Col. 4. 8.</note> man can, neither will any wiſe man condemne eloquence, or forbid by any good meanes, to attaine to the gift. To ſpeake raſhly, without diſcretion in ſo holy things, is a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Gods name in vaine. All men muſt order their words with diſcretion, much more in that place a Miniſter. As men write warily, ſo muſt they ſpeake reſpectiuely: neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of right ſpeaking occaſions much miſtaking. It hath bred hereſies; contentions haue and doe grow hereby, and and many mens labours are deſpiſed by neglect of this, whoſe paines might well be approoued for the matter, and become an effectuall miniſterie through Gods bleſſing, by hauing care to ſpeake as they ought.<note place="margin">Of the voice in ſpeaking, and how it must be ordered.</note>
               </p>
               <p>With the wordes there muſt be a care to the ſound of the voice. The voice muſt bee ſo farre lift vp, as it may alwaies be heard; but not ſtrained aboue natures power, neither one ſound throughout, but tuneable, riſing or falling as the

The voice is ſo to be guided as the hearers not vnderſtanding the matter, may yet by the manner diſcerne where about you are: wee may not be loud where we ſhould be low, nor ſpeake cheerefully in lamentable matters, nor mournfully in cauſes of reioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing.

               <p>Some there be which haue comelineſſe of countenance,<note place="margin">Vnſeemely ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, and how they bee gotten, and how to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</note> and right proportioned of body, yet want ſeemely geſture: Firſt, either by raſh boldneſſe, or an inconſiderate zeale at the beginning, and by heart of affection, which haue mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued them to violent motions, as caſting abroad of their armes, ſmiting on the Pulpit, lifting themſelues vp, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine ſuddenly ſtamping downe very vnaduiſedly. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or by too great feare and baſhfulneſſe, which cauſeth hemmings, ſpitting, rubbing the browes, lifting vp of the ſhoulders, nodding of the head, taking often hold of the cloake or gowne, fidling with the fingers vpon the breaſt, buttons, ſtroaking of the beard and ſuch like toies. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or els by acting vpon a ſtage, who cannot but ſhew their vaine and phantaſticall motions ridiculouſly in a Pulpit, which they haue vſed in prophane paſtimes.</p>
               <p>The firſt ſeeming furious, may amend by conſiderate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation. The ſecond fearefull, by getting a godly bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, conſidering himſelfe as a ſpeaker vnto man, from and

               <p>But to preuent theſe, before we begin, it is good to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue: Firſt, what is comely in others, what defectiue.

Thirdly to haue ſome faithfull friend to note vs and to admoniſh vs, leſt wee get an vſe of an euill before we be aware, and ſo cannot amend the fault, neither as we ſhould, nor as we would.</p>
